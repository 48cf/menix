# Contributing

There are only these very simple rules which your submission should follow:

- **NO** discriminatory behavior, everyone should be welcome to contribute.
- Every submission should solve exactly **ONE** problem.
- Your submission **MUST** be written by you.
- Your code **MUST** be licensed under the project's main license, or
  one that has less restrictions.

In terms of coding style, always have code formatted with `rustfmt`.
